# TeamVeiwerPopupKill
A small program I wrote to get rid of that obnoxious "Sponsored Session" popup from TeamViewer.

This script will continuously look for the two popups windows that TeamViewer launches when you exit.

It automatically closes those windows and then activates whatever window was up before the popups.
